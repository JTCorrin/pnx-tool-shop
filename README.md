**üìÉ Creating Custom Tools:**

You can create custom tools by extending the StructuredTool class. Here's an example of defining a custom tool:

```typescript
import { StructuredTool, StructuredToolInput } from 'pnx';
import { z } from 'zod';

const CustomToolSchema = z.object({
  // Define your schema here
});

class CustomTool extends StructuredTool<typeof CustomToolSchema> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      name: "Custom Tool",
      description: "Describe your custom tool",
      schema: CustomToolSchema,
      requiresReview: false, // These 2 flags will notify pnx is additional steps need to be taken once this tool has been used
      requiresResponse: true,
      func: async (input) => {
        // Implement your tool's functionality
        return "Result of your custom tool";
      },
    });
  }
}
```
